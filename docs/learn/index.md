Websites built with Python and Bottle aren't too intimidating and many of the concepts will be familiar to you if you have used Python before.

You still write all your website code in HTML and CSS files, the main difference is that instead of loading those files directly in the browser, you use a Python program to read the browser URLs and decide which pages to show.
